                <h2>Giving Back</h2>
                <p>I believe in giving back to the community by always taking into consideration how my actions and work will impact the society and of my peers. I consistently try to participate in volunteer, no matter how big or small, ranging from the Houston food bank to Tamu's Big Event, to the CS department's events. I've also found ways to academically help the next generation of students, as I was a Mathnasium tutor and now currently am a Teaching Assistant in CSCE120. I love being able to help the students get the sense of accomplishment when they solve problems, and I hope that I really was able to make an impact in these people's lives! </p>

                    <h2><a href = "https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">Big Event</h2></a>
                    <p>As a group leader and member of big event, I collaborated with a team of volunteers to help families in our community with whatever they needed. This past spring, I helped construct a flowerbed, clean up a fountain, and designed tiles and rocks for our recipient's front yard. </p>

                    <p>At the Houston Food Bank, I helped sort and package food for families in need. I contributed to the packaging of over 10,000 pounds of food in a few hours, supporting the Houston Food Bank's mission to fight hunger and provide nutritious meals to those in need. </p>
