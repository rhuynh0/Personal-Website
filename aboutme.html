                    <h2>About Me </h2>
                    <p>Howdy! My name is Richard Huynh and I am a computer science student studying at <a href = "https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html"> Texas A&M University</a>. At a young age, my father constantly drilled into me the importance of learning to the highest potential I could. He taught me to explore little ideas of interest within our world, to help me discover my appeal. The discovery of the iPad from my aunt piqued my interest, as it defied my views of nature and physics. It was so hard for me to process how a simple black screen as thin as a notebook, was able to contain the information tenfold. Within this vast database of information, a computer has the ability to generate its own knowledge based on information and data we feed it, reflecting the evolutions I desire to experience with human brain functions. Throughout my career, I’ve had many opportunities to explore the importance of computer science within society today. A simple OpenAI chatbot has the ability to write emails, essays, or even code based on a prompt given. </p>
                    <p>This field of computer science will continue as artificial intelligence grows and takes over the fields of automation and technology. Routine tasks are able to be automated and other fields of work are able to be made simpler, safer, and more efficient, improving the quality and standards of living for many. I believe that this new technology shouldn’t be feared and suppressed, but supported and invested within. Every huge accomplishment in history has aspects of instability and uncertainty, but humanity always pushes through with the purpose of exploration and advancement. </p>
                    <p>This vision and belief also applies to me through my social and professional experiences. I took on many experiences such as a student tutor at <a href = "https://www.mathnasium.com/math-centers?campaign=20244929898&content=661048485066&keyword=mathnasium&matchtype=e&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Google_Search_Brand-Core_US_Core2_Exact+Phrase_Tinuiti&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwooq3BhB3EiwAYqYoEjvz5Oi66Vg4dKvmeiZfnk6R_9UXt302Lo1MHgVHXGR9jRl-4ZUnfBoClvAQAvD_BwE">Mathnasium</a>, a server for <a href = "https://iwonkoreanbbq.com/">IWon Korean Bbq and Hotpot</a>, a teaching assistant for a computer science class, and a data science analyst intern for Ticketmaster, Live Nations. With the time left I have at Texas A&M, I try to continue participating in other orgs and activities so that I am able to influence the next generation and to support my vision of our society for exploration and advancement. As one of our industry leaders, Mark Zuckerburg quotes, “The biggest risk is not taking any risk”.</p>
